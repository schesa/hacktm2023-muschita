Make sure you join Innovation Labs Romania  Awesome alumni's: Rayscape, Helperz.ro, AIMINDED, Blume Technologies, and more, incl Bringo (Bucharest). Register  David, Rebeca & Team are rockstars  Techstars Startup Weekend Oradea was a blast!  Techstars Startup Weekend Oradea 2023 was something different...Even though I've already organized a dozen events for the tech/startup community, this was special...1⃣st - it was HARD! Personally, I don't remember recently, an event/initiative for which I had to push it that hard in order to pull this off. And I'm sharing this with you because, for many, it might look just like sunshine and roses. Well, it's not. For the last 4 weeks, I personally worked more than 12h/day. I had many nights I would wake up early in the morning and my mind couldn't stop thinking about what and how can I do better in order to convince people to join an experience that I knew will change their mindset and even life... So for those of you around people doing similar stuff, appreciate them, help them, and support them! IT'S HAAAARD!!!! For those of you doing this: Don't give up! I really hope you will find the resources to push it until the end! 2⃣nd - it was UNEXPECTED! I didn't expect to have 70 people in the first day... I didn't expect to have 15 pitches... I didn't expect 2 teams not to show up on the 2nd day and another one to give up later... I didn't expect another 2 teams to be reborn from the ashes... I didn't expect my car to break... The unexpected feeling is a mixed feeling, but I think it's what makes us human more than anything else... We tend to be in control of everything. We can't, and THAT IS FINE!3⃣rd - it was ENCOURAGING! The team was incredible, I worked with new colleagues that did the extra mile with JOY, pushed forward, found solutions, etc. Kudos to you all Georgeta Bocșe beatrice bungo Raluca Naom Rebeca Avram Mihaela Bancila Pătcaș Cristian Ciprian Trip Bogdan Berke  The partners supporting this event, I am blessed to have you thank you Creatopy (CC: Ioana Ciobanu Gabriel Ciordas), LiftUP Solutions (CC Marcel Boscaneanu), Octavic (CC Paul Harfas), Paymo (CC Jan Lukacs) and Mobiversal (Alin Merches).

Andrei Cosmin Munteanu, I cannot thank you enough for your personal support for this event and the way you facilitated everything and doing the extra mile, for FREE! We need more Andreis :) Last but not least... I was encouraged to see young people still willing to push it hard, sleepless nights, hours of ideation, pivoting, feedback, validation. Congrats to you!

Thank you, start-up.ro!  It's amazing what you can do in and around coworking spaces. Don't take our word for it. Check it out. #teamworkmakesthedreamwork What about Team Managers? What can you do to get back to the new normal with your team?We got a few ideas for you.  Reconnect & bond by working together in person (you can do that by renting a private office at Cowork Timisoara).  Take a day for you and your team to work together whenever you need to brainstorm a strategy or find some alignment in your vision (you can rent our terrace deck for that).  Create opportunities for your team to interact outside of daily tasks. This is the most direct way to foster genuine relationships between employees, especially those that don't work together often (you can do that by hosting or contracting us to organize a networking event for you and your team). What do you say?Check out our offers at the link in the first comment and let us know  #teammanagement #work #team #networking What's your style? #coworking #workfromanywhere Over the years, we noticed three main coworking styles that most of our customers have been using: The always-on-the-go style - the most flexible of them all - suits those coworkers that travel a lot and end up landing in a coffee shop hoping for a stable wi-fi connection and a relatively decent atmosphere for their zoom calls. And then think otherwise, and have productive work days in our space. The flexible style usually comes in handy to people who don't have difficulties adapting and could use a scenery change from time to time, but still, regularly. And the grounded one. This style is used by people who need a dedicated space for their office - a place they know they can come back to, no matter how long it has been.Which style is your style? And most importantly, which of our service packages suits it best? Find out by clicking the link in the first comment  #work #officespace #coworkingspace #worklife  Calling al #devices enthusiasts!

Chiar dacă am organizat deja o caruță de evenimente pentru comunitatea tech/startup-uri, acesta a fost special... In primul rand a fost GREU! Personal, nu-mi amintesc recent, un eveniment/inițiativă pentru care a trebuit să trag atât de mult ca să reușim realizarea ei. Și vă spun asta deoarece, pentru mulți, ar putea arăta ca ”nu mare brânză”. Ei bine, nu este. În ultimele 4 săptămâni, personal am lucrat mai mult de 12 ore/zi. Am avut multe nopți în care mă trezeam dimineața devreme și mintea mea nu se putea opri să se gândească la ce și cum pot face mai bine pentru a-i convinge pe oameni să se alăture unei experiențe despre care știam că le va schimba mentalitatea și chiar viața... Așadar, pentru oamenii din jurul vostru care fac lucruri similare, apreciați-i, ajutați-i și sprijiniți-i! ESTE GREEEEEUUUU!!!! Pentru cei care faceți asta: Nu renunțați! Sper din tot sufletul că veți găsi resursele pentru a o duce până la capăt! In al doilea rand, a fost NEAȘTEPTAT! Nu mă așteptam să avem 70 de oameni în prima zi... Nu mă așteptam să avem 15 pitch-uri... Nu mă așteptam să nu apară 2 echipe în ziua a 2-a și încă una să renunțe mai târziu ... Nu mă așteptam să renască din cenușă alte 2 echipe... Nu mă așteptam să mi se strice mașina... Sentimentul de ”neașteptat” este un sentiment mixt, dar cred că este ceea ce ne face oameni mai mult decât orice altceva... Avem tendința de a avea controlul asupra tuturor lucrurilor. Nu putem, și E OK! In al treilea rand - a fost ÎNCURAJANT! Echipa a fost incredibilă, am lucrat cu noi colegi care au făcut ”the extra mile” cu BUCURIE, au mers înainte, au găsit soluții etc. Felicitări tuturor Georgeta Bocșe, Beatrice Bungo, Raluca Naom, Rebeca Avram, Mihaela Bancila, Pătcaș Cristian, Ciprian Trip, Bogdan Berke Partenerilor care au susținut acest eveniment, sunt binecuvântat să vă am, Creatopy (CC: Ioana Ciobanu Gabriel Ciordas), LiftUP Solutions (CC Marcel Boscaneanu), Octavic (CC Paul Harfas), Paymo (CC Jan Lukacs) și Mobiversal (Alin Merches). Am avut mentori care au stat acolo ore și ore, ajutând, dând feedback și încurajând. Mulțumesc Andrei Gadoiu, Razvan Suta, Catalin Rus, Ioana Rus, Malina Lucia Turcut, Tudor Cutus, Andrei Firoiu, Adrian Gheara, Gery Meleg, Vlad Santa, Adrian Cucerzan, Roland Szabo, Dumitru Palanciuc, Cosmin Pirvu, Mircea Vădan, Ciprian Trip, Rishi Chattopadhyay! Am avut prieteni care veneau la mine și îmi țineau moralul ridicat și apreciau energia, experiența, efortul. Andrei Cosmin Munteanu, nu pot să-ți mulțumesc îndeajuns pentru sprijinul tău personal pentru acest eveniment și pentru modul în care ai facilitat totul și ai făcut multeeee extra miles, just to give back! Avem nevoie de mai multi Andrei de-ăștia Nu în ultimul rând... Am fost încurajat să văd tineri încă dispuși să tragă din greu, nopți nedormite, ore de brainstorming, pivotare, feedback și validare. Felicitări vouă! Sunteți câștigătorii, deși nu știți încă! Și nu în ultimul ultimul rând, mulțumesc Luciana pentru ca m-ai suportat, încurajat, susținut, sacrificat.
